            <p>They have nothing in the center of the screen, it is more
                apparent in the desktop version but in the mobile version
                they have something up top, a logo of what they worked on
                upper middle and then theyâ€™re name and slogan on the bottom.</p>

            <p>The main thing people will come to this site for is to
                see the work done by them. They made the link to their
                work land right where your thumb would be when your browsing to the site</p>

            <p>I picked this one because of how clean the page is.
                There is one button up in the top corner and then
                just one picture just about fills the screen as your
                scroll down. Even the menu is only 4 options. It makes
                browsing their site very simple</p>
